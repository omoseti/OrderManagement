# ðŸ“¦ OrderManagement  
This is a sample .NET 8 Web API for managing orders, customers, and discounts. It demonstrates clean architecture, proper design patterns, and robust testing.  
________________________________________  
âœ… Discounting System  
â€¢	Applies discount rules dynamically based on customer segments (Regular vs. VIP).  
â€¢	Easily extendable for more advanced promotions.  
âœ… Order Status Tracking  
â€¢	Tracks order state with clear transitions (Created â†’ Fulfilled).  
â€¢	Designed for future states like Cancelled or OnHold.  
âœ… Order Analytics Endpoint  
â€¢	Provides real-time metrics:  
â€¢ Average order value  
â€¢	Average fulfillment time (in hours)  
âœ… Testing  
â€¢	Thorough unit tests for discount logic.  
â€¢	Integration tests for creating orders with multiple items and verifying totals.  
âœ… Documentation & Swagger  
â€¢	All endpoints are documented with XML comments.  
â€¢	Swagger UI enabled for easy testing and exploration.  
âœ… Performance Considerations  
â€¢	Uses AsNoTracking() for read-only queries in analytics to reduce EF Core tracking overhead.  
________________________________________  
âœ… Assumptions  
â€¢	Customer must pre-exist; only CustomerId is accepted.  
â€¢	Discounts depend only on customer segment for now.  
â€¢	Testing Environment: Uses EF Core InMemory database for simplicity in tests  
â€¢	Analytics endpoint is real-time; caching can be added.  
________________________________________  
ðŸ§© Design Patterns  
â€¢	Repository & Unit of Work (via EF Core DbContext)  
â€¢	Service Layer (OrderService, DiscountService)  
â€¢	Dependency Injection (configured in Program.cs)  
â€¢	DTOs (API models separate from entities)
